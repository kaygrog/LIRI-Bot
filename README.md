# LIRI-Bot

LIRI is a bot similar to iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives the user back data.

### LIRI demo video

This [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBaQOv32lao) demonstrates how to use LIRI in Git Bash.

## What this project does

LIRI uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to search for songs, the [Bands in Town](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api) API to search for concerts, and the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) to search for movies.

## Why this project is useful

This project was my eighth assignment for my coding boot camp, and it was useful in helping me learn about Node, JavaScript, and API calls.
